# Introduction
FE-DeTr includes a novel keypoint detection network that fuses the textural and structural information from image frames with the high-temporal-resolution motion information from event streams. The network leverages a temporal response consistency for supervision, ensuring stable and efficient keypoint detection. Moreover, we use a spatio-temporal nearest-neighbor search strategy for robust keypoint tracking.
